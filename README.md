# IMPORTANT:

# All the documentation is inside the docs folder.

# Inside backend folder, it's the final version of our web app that works well.

Inside prototype folder, it's the prototype version of our web app, which doesn't use database and other stuff yet.

Other additional artifacts are under the issues tab in github (between "Code" and "Pull requests" at the top), it tracks part of our incremental assignments while building the project.
