1. Movie Rating Prediction:
- Basic idea: Our goal is to predict movie ratings for some combination of cast members / characters (real & non-real) and use sentimenta analysis on the movies they've been in to better determine the score of our imaginary movie. This program will take in as input a variety of cast members (actors, directors, producers, etc).
- Database: We will use MongoDB as the database to store users' data (general information, preference, search history, etc).
- 2 publicly available data sets: IMDb API & Watson sentiment analysis. Reach for existing movies and cast members to attain ratings and then use sentiment analysis on the movies the cast members have been in to better determine the score.
- Third-party authentication: Instagram / Facebook / Google / Twitter / Amazon / Apple or other social medias
- Decoupled architecture: Frontend (Javascript/CSS/HTML) - RESTful API - backend (Ruby/PHP/Java/.Net/Python/OCaml)

2. Restaurant Recommendation:
- A simple user story: I'm a BU student. When it's time for lunch, but I don't know what to eat and where. Just type in "lunch" in search box, and the application will recommand some dishes based on my preference (with the restaurant name & price stuff) near campus.
- Database: Personal preference about food, such as cuisine (Italian, Mexican, Asian, British, American,...), flavors(spicy, sweet, salty,...), ingredients(meat, vegetables, fruits,...), allergies(nuts, diary, seafood,...), faith(vegetarian, religion,...), etc.
- 2 publicly available data sets: The menu of restraunts near / in BU & general recipe for popular dishes from Internet & Google Maps
- Third-party authentication: Gmail / phone number / instagram account(even though it's basically Facebook account)
- Decoupled architecture: Frontend (HTML/Javascript) - RESTful API - backend (Python/Javascript/Java/C/OCaml/PHP)
