1. Movie Rating Prediction:
- Basic idea: Our goal is to predict movie ratings for some combination of cast memebers / characters (real & non-real). This program will take in as input a variety of cast members (actors, directors, producers, etc).
- Database: We will use MongoDB as the database to store users' data (general information, preference, search history, etc).
- 2 publicly available data sets: IMDb API / Rotten Tomatoes API. Reach for existed movies' news, critics and public reviews and ratings, pictures, trailers and more.
- Third-party authentication: Instagram / Facebook / Google / Twitter / Amazon / Apple or other social medias
- Decoupled architecture: Frontend (Javascript/CSS/HTML) - RESTful API - backend (Ruby/PHP/Java/.Net/Python/OCaml)

2. Restaurant Recommendation:
- A simple user story: I'm a BU student. When it's time for lunch, but I don't know what to eat and where. Just type in "lunch" in search box, and the application will recommand some dishes based on my preference (with the restaurant name & price stuff) near campus.
- Database: Personal preference about food, such as cuisine (Italian, Mexican, Asian, British, American,...), flavors(spicy, sweet, salty,...), ingredients(meat, vegetables, fruits,...), allergies(nuts, diary, seafood,...), faith(vegetarian, religion,...), etc.
- 2 publicly available data sets: The menu of restraunts near / in BU & general recipe for popular dishes from Internet & Google Maps
- Third-party authentication: Gmail / phone number / instagram account(even though it's basically Facebook account)
- Decoupled architecture: Frontend (HTML/Javascript) - RESTful API - backend (Python/Javascript/Java/C/OCaml/PHP)
