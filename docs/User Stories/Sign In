Topic sentence:
  As a user, I want to sign in my account to access this web application and search the score of the chosen movie.

Happy path: 
1. I am able to sign in using my google account and see a message notifies me that I have sign in via google successfully.
 
Exceptions: 
1. As a user, if I failed to sign in with the current google account that I have I would like to see an error message telling me this issue.

Why this function is important for our app?
1. Every time users want to use this web application, they can just login using their google account and nothing more 
needed. Since it is easy for users to use, it benefits us because we want more users to use our app.
