Topic sentence:
  As a user, I want to sign in my account to access this web application and search the score of movie with my selection (actors, directors, and so on), 
see my personal profile, probably review my search history.

Happy path: 
1. Right after signed up an new account, I see the web page jumping from authentication back to the app and I have already signed in. Then, it refers to 
the user story of "Store/View Personal Profile and Basic Information."
2. A few hours/days/months after signed up and filled out basic information for my new account of this web app, I open it and see the login page 
with sign-in/sign-up options. I click on sign-in button and it shows login with Facebook/Instagram account. After I click the account that I used for 
registration, the page jumps to authentication. Then, I type in my account username and password to log in. After the authentication succeeds, the page 
jumps back to the web app. Right now, I can search the score of movie with my selection (actors, directors, and so on), see my personal profile, probably 
review my search history. Specifically, If I want to search the score of movie with my selection (actors, directors, and so on), it refers to the user 
story of "Search Preference." If I want to see/change my personal profile or review my search history, it refers to the user story of "Store/View Personal 
Profile and Basic Information." 
 
Exceptions: 
1. As a user, if my account does not exist in this web app, I expect to see the error message saying that "No such account exists" so that I can sign up 
my account first then sign in.

Why this function is important for our app?
1. Every time users want to use this web application, they can just login in the Facebook/Instagram account that they used for register and nothing more 
needed. Since it is easy for users to use, it benefits us because we want more users to use our app.
