Topic sentence: The user will use our website interface to input a minimum of 2 cast members (either within the same category or between 2 different ones) by 
typing their names in a text box which will then allow them to submit their input.

Happy path: The user will have provided two cast members that our website is able to find on the IMDB database where our calculations will be done.

Exceptions: In the case where the user either mispells the name of a cast member or they inputed them into the wrong catergory (such as putting Tom Cruise as 
a director), the website will have to return an error notifying the user of their mistake and how they can fix it. This is also applicable to when a user
only inputs one name.

Why this function is important for our app?
This function is probably the most important one of our website as it encompasses the main goal of our project. Users will be spending the majority of their
time using this functionaility, therefore we must define it as clearly as possible in order to ensure they have a smooth experience.
