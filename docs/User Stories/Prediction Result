Prediction Result

As a user on this movie prediction website, I want to have a simple “predict” button that can be clicked on to show the prediction result. 
After choosing all the preferences I wanted for the movie, I would like to have one button that can do the prediction for me at just one click. 
In this way, I can easily and quickly obtain a prediction result for my preferences. 

In addition to the “predict” button, I want the website to show a simple and clear prediction result for the characteristics I chose for 
the imaginary movie. The website should display a prediction score for the imaginary movie and indicate the meaning of this score so that 
I have a full understanding of the prediction method and the reliability of the score. In the case of exception, such as not choosing enough 
features when clicked on the "predict" button, I would want to see an error message to remind me the mistake.
