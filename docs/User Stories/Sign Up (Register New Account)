Topic sentence:
As a user, I want to sign up in order to access this web application, have a personal profile, and be able to review my search history.

Happy path: 
  I open this web application, it shows up a login page that allows me to choose sign-in or sign-up. Since I'm a new user, I click on the sign-up button 
to register an account. Then, it asks me to register through Facebook/Instagram account. I choose one of them, and it jumps to an authentication page 
that asks for my account username and password so I type in them. After it shows "authentication success," it jumps back to the web application, and I 
can start to type some basic information for my profile/account. Then it refers to the user story of "Store/View Personal Profile."

Exceptions: 
1. As a user, I want to see an error message saying that "No valid account found" if my account username or password for authentication is wrong so that 
I want try it again.
2. As a user, I want to see an error message saying that "Lost connection to Internet" if I lost my Internet connection so that I can re-connect my 
Internet, refresh the page, and retry the step.

Why this function is important for our app?
1. Registering the new account by using an existing social media account is convenient for users so that they don't need to remember all the account 
name and password for different application. If it's convenient for users, they will like to use our app so it's also beneficial for us. 
2. Having a distinct account for each user helps us as developers to keep track of their searching activities so that we can see what is the most common 
words they typed. Then, we can improve our app around those key words.
3. Having each user basic informtaion stored helps us to analyze and predict who are the primary clients for our app so that we can develop new features 
for them to provide better user experience.
