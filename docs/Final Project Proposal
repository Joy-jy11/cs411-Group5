Movie Rating Average Score:

- Basic idea: Our goal is to collect movie ratings from different websites and then calculate and display the average movie rating based
on the scores we obtained from different movie rating websites (could be IMDB, Metacritic, the MovieDb, and filmAffinity). At the same time, 
we will display movie's name and year of release.

- Database: We will use SQLite as our database to store users' data (general information, search history, etc).

- 2 publicly available data sets: IMDb API & OMDB API. Reach for existing movies and cast members to attain ratings, movie descrptions, and movie year.

- Third-party authentication: Google 

- Decoupled architecture: Frontend (React) - RESTful API - backend (Django)
