 Movie Rating Average Score:
- Basic idea: Our goal is to display movie ratings from differen websites and, able to calculate and display the average movie score based
on the scores we obtained from different movie rating websites (Could be IMDB, RottenTomato, and etc).
- Database: We will use MongoDB as the database to store users' data (general information, preference, search history, etc).
- 2 publicly available data sets: IMDb API & OMDB API. Reach for existing movies and cast members to attain ratings, movie descrptions, and movie year.
- Third-party authentication: Google 
- Decoupled architecture: Frontend (Javascript/CSS/HTML) - RESTful API - backend (Ruby/PHP/Java/.Net/Python/OCaml)
