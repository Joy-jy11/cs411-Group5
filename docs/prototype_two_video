The link below is a video showing our website's functionality during the team assignment 2 period. At the time, our website is 
still solely relying on the frontend and could not communicate the user input from the frontend to the backend. Though the backend was missing 
at this point, learning how to develop the frontend and make the search function actually working was very valuable and important. Understanding
the frontend also helped us to rebuild our website. I also had fun building the UI for the frontend.
