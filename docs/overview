1. Predict movie ratings for some combination of cast memebers / characters (real & non-real):
The program will take in as input a variety of cast members (actors, directors, producers, etc...)
It will then access the imdb database to calculate an average rating for a hypothetical movie containing each cast member
Use a sentiment analysis to help predict the movie success (such as the rating)


2. Restaurant recommendation:
- A simple user story: I'm a BU student. When it's time for lunch, but I don't know what to eat and where. Just type in "lunch" in search box, and the application will recommand some dishes based on my preference (with the restaurant name & price stuff) near campus.
- Database: personal preference about food, such as cuisine (Italian, Mexican, Asian, British, American,...), flavors(spicy, sweet, salty,...), ingredients(meat, vegetables, fruits,...), allergies(nuts, diary, seafood,...), faith(vegetarian, religion,...), and so on.
- 2 publicly available data sets: the menu of restraunts near/in BU & general recipe for popular dishes from Internet & Google Maps
- Third-party authentication: Gmail / phone number / instagram account(even though it's basically Facebook account)
- Decoupled architecture: frontend (HTML/Javascript) - RESTful interface (don't know what it is???) - backend (Python/Javascript/Java/C/Ocaml/PHP)
